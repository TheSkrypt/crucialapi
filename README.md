# Crucial API
Crucial API was created to simplify your everyday tasks as a spigot developer and to fill the spigot API's holes by adding many useful APIs for tasks that the spigot API does not incorporate or does so in just a small and insufficient amount.
This way, you can fully concentrate on making your idea come to live in a much shorter time.

## Chat API
Obviously, it is possible to send messages with Bukkit. But for those who are tired of implementing a method to add prefixes before the messages or translate the color & formatting codes, you can use this API. All you need is to create a Message using the sleek builder pattern and the API takes care of the rest! Additionally, it fully supports the Language API (more about that below), so all your messages can be translated to +100 supported languages!

## Language API
Tired of taking care of those language files and translating them? Although this API won't take over the translation part for you, it takes over the management over these files and already supports +100 languages! All you need to do is create the english file and the API automatically adds any newly created key-value pairs to the present files! Additionally, the API checks your data folder on each start-up for newly created language files and automatically uses them if configured so - that means your end-users can take over the translation part for themselves and translate your plugin to as many languages as we support!
