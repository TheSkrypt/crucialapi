# Crucial API
Crucial API was created to simplify your everyday tasks as a spigot developer and to fill the spigot API's holes by adding many useful APIs for tasks that the spigot API does not incorporate or does so in just a small and insufficient amount.
This way, you can fully concentrate on making your idea come to live in a much shorter time.
